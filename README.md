# Project Name
> Our solution has helped overcome all these problems with easy of access features, we have created a web-application 
 which gets the complete information of services from all the servers listed in a particular environment.

## Problem Statement
- Every Enterprise level product is distributed across many servers for better performance and convenience. Since it has many servers, 
 all should be maintained well and look after. But to do that it takes time as an engineer has to go to the remote servers and check them 
 manually which takes lots of time and then to look for a particular component at that server is a gruesome task.

## Limitations
- Inconvenient to check status of various components hosted on multiple servers in case of issues in system.
- Inconvenient to check status of various components hosted on multiple servers in case of issues in system.
- On production system, we have around 20 odd servers where the components are deployed, troubleshooting this setup 
is pain at times.

## Technologies Used
- Angular
- Ado.net
- Entity framework
- Web API

## Idea/Solution
-To tackle this problem, we produced a solution in the form of a product which display the required services 
 along with their health status with the added benefit of auto refresh so that the latest status of the components is easily available. 
 Along with this we also shows the upwards as well as the downwards dependency of the component in a comprehensible, readable format.


## Business Values	
-As our solution is dynamic, we can support multiple servers and various products. Its easily scalable and shippable to various environments and products.
-Our solution is a centralized system which provides complete information about all the servers and its services at one place ,so it 
 will give a good InSite of our project and will save time .
-With the help of our system we can easily trace the error and will figure out its root cause.
-Ultimately the application saves time and maintenance effort effectively.  


## Future Scope
-It can be a centralized system which can provide detailed and pr√©cised information about servers and its services. 
-Manipulation of server components  can be achieved in further enhancement.
-We can show a UML diagram which will provide upward and downward dependency of each service.
